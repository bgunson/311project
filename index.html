    <h1>An Artistic Representation of a Photon</h1>
    <h2>ART 311 Project</h2>

        Initially, I began this project under the "green" theme. The first thing that came to mind when I thought of green was not the typical
        things like plants, environment, recycling, whatever. Instead I thought of old computer terminals consisting of text-only prompts with the classic
        green courier font much like this web page.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started with my fascination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection">3D projection</a>, something that goes beyond my very limited
        grasp of linear algebra I attained from my first year math course. Previously I had spent time programming small LCD/OLED displays with 
        very primitive graphics and had drawn the rotation of a projected cube. Below you can see the graphic I am speaking on, click the frame to begin the animation.

        This simple animation can be altered to create interesting patterns. In the above animation we are wiping the screen of the prior frame 
        each time we draw which gives the effect that the cube is rotating. If we do not wipe the screen each iteration, then all previous cubes
        remain drawn. Their overlapping edges and vertices create very unique shapes and if we alter the size of the cube each frame then these shapes 
        become even more apparent. The cube's rotation is also different each time it reaches its min/max size and chosen at random from an interval
        spanning small negative and positive floating point numbers. A negative rotation delta represents counter-clockwise rotation and positive vice-versa.

       As this stands, these animations are still very simple but the do represent my initial perception of the green theme. Old text-only 
       computer operating systems were simple in nature and so is a rotating cube. I was originally prototyping this project using Processing using a 
       different projection algorithm as anchored above. When I went to translate the implementation from Processing to JavaScript the animation broke
       entirely. So, I tried my best to find the flaw and get it working which I could not do. In my attempt to salvage the cube rotation I accidentally
       created something quite beautiful. In the next animation, we do not draw edges from the vertices which represent the frame of the cube but 
       from each vertex to the origin of the cube. In this case the origin is the center of the canvas. We allow the rotation to continue and spawn
       anywhere from 1 to 5 "cubes" on top of each other, all with different colour profiles, sizes, and rotation deltas. The result can be seen below.

        At this point, my sketches do not much represent the green theme anymore. To me the sketch above makes me feel as if I am a photon 
        racing through a fibre optic cable at the speed of light. So this made me ponder my own perception of a photon. Photons can behave as both 
        a wave and a particle, but what do they look like? We may never know so the least I can do is try to represent one artistically.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here begins my artistic interpretation of the quantum mystery: the photon. I took the above sketch and replaced the straight, unnatural
        lines from the vertices to the origin with bezier curves. The curves are defined using variables from the rotation logic at random. Basically, I 
        chose anchor points which added an exaggerated curve but to the point where the end shape is not unnatural. I believe a photon to be somewhat
        natural in its existence. They are the basis for pretty much all life and energy in the universe. Play the animation below, double-click to reset the 
        sketch. Each time or page refresh you will see a different representation of a photon, each with different colours, shapes, and feelings.
